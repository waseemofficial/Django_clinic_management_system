How to use?
===========


You can import ``moment`` from ``js.momentjs`` and ``need`` it where you want
these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.momentjs import moment
  >>> moment.need()

By default no locale information is included. However you can choose
to include all the timezone data::

  >>> from js.momentjs import moment_with_locales
  >>> moment_with_locales.need()
