***********

Introduction
============

This library packages `Moment.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`Moment.js`: http://momentjs.com/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.momentjs``) are published to some URL.


How to use?
===========


You can import ``moment`` from ``js.momentjs`` and ``need`` it where you want
these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.momentjs import moment
  >>> moment.need()

By default no locale information is included. However you can choose
to include all the timezone data::

  >>> from js.momentjs import moment_with_locales
  >>> moment_with_locales.need()
